Stock Analysis over three years using VBA script

Using VBA script that loops through all stocks for each year and outputs a summary table including:
  - Ticker symbol for each stock
  - Yearly change price for the each Ticker Symbol stock
  - Percentage change for each Ticker Symbol stock
  - Total Volume for each Ticker Symbol stock
  - Summary of the Greatest Percentage Increase, Greatest Percentage Decrease and Greatest Total Volume including Ticker Symbol and Value for each.

The script runs on three worksheets for three year's of stock data.
Conditional formatting is applied via VBA script for color coding to highlight positive and negative Yearly Change in stock price. Number formatting on the Percent Change column to include appropriate decimal values and the percent symbol. Final formatting includes script for AutoFit on each column.
